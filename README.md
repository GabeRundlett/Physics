# Physics

I created this repository to solve the problems in my Physics class, but it turned into a fun project where I could experiment with creating a good UI/UX in C++. To compile this repository, one must have the [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build system and the [Conan](https://conan.io/) C++ package manager installed.
