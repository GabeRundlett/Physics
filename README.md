# Physics

I created this repository to solve the problems in my Physics class, but it turned into a fun project where I could experiment with creating a good UI/UX in C++. To compile this repository, one must have my debugging library installed, which is located [here](https://github.com/GabeRundlett/Debug). This makes the project Linux-only for now. When cloning the repository, remember to add the flag `--recurse-submodules` to clone both my 'fork' of glad and the official GLFW repository.

In order to build this repository, all one needs is cmake installed, however I would recommend using Microsoft's CMake extension inside of VSCode.
